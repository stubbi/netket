    Custom Sampler, where transition operators are specified by the user.
    For the moment, this functionality is limited to transition operators which
    are sums of $$k$$-local operators:

    $$
    \mathcal{M}= \sum_i M_i
    $$

    where the move operators $$ M_i $$ act on an (arbitrary) subset of sites.

    The operators $$ M_i $$ are specified giving their matrix elements, and a list
    of sites on which they act. Each operator $$ M_i $$ must be real,
    symmetric, positive definite and stochastic (i.e. sum of each column and line is 1).

    The transition probability associated to a custom sampler can be decomposed into two steps:

    1. One of the move operators $$ M_i $$ is chosen with a weight given by the
    user (or uniform probability by default). If the weights are provided,
    they do not need to sum to unity.

    2. Starting from state
    $$ |n \rangle $$, the probability to transition to state
    $$ |m\rangle $$ is given by
    $$ \langle n|  M_i | m \rangle $$.

             stochastic move (transition) operators.

                        The probability distribution being sampled
                        from is $$F(\Psi(s))$$, where the function

                      $$\mathcal{M}= \sum_i M_i$$ used for transitions.
                 move_weights: For each $$ i $$, the probability to pick one of
                      the move operators (must sum to one).
