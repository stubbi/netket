    This sampler generates i.i.d. samples from $$|\Psi(s)|^2$$.
    In order to perform exact sampling, $$|\Psi(s)|^2$$ is precomputed an all
    the possible values of the quantum numbers $$s$$. This sampler has thus an
    exponential cost with the number of degrees of freedom, and cannot be used
    for large systems, where Metropolis-based sampling are instead a viable
    option.

             Args:
                 machine: A machine $$\Psi(s)$$ used for the sampling.
                          The probability distribution being sampled
                          from is $$F(\Psi(s))$$, where the function

                 Exact sampling from a RBM machine in a 1D lattice of spin 1/2
