    This sampler acts locally only on two local degree of freedom $$ s_i $$ and $$ s_j $$,
    and proposes a new state: $$ s_1 \dots s^\prime_i \dots s^\prime_j \dots s_N $$,
    where in general $$ s^\prime_i \neq s_i $$ and $$ s^\prime_j \neq s_j $$ .
    The sites $$ i $$ and $$ j $$ are also chosen to be within a maximum graph
    distance of $$ d_{\mathrm{max}} $$.

    The transition probability associated to this sampler can
    be decomposed into two steps:

    1. A pair of indices $$ i,j = 1\dots N $$, and such
    that $$ \mathrm{dist}(i,j) \leq d_{\mathrm{max}} $$,
    is chosen with uniform probability.
    2. The sites are exchanged, i.e. $$ s^\prime_i = s_j $$ and $$ s^\prime_j = s_i $$.

    Notice that this sampling method generates random permutations of the quantum
    numbers, thus global quantities such as the sum of the local quantum n
    umbers are conserved during the sampling.
    This scheme should be used then only when sampling in a
    region where $$ \sum_i s_i = \mathrm{constant} $$ is needed,
    otherwise the sampling would be strongly not ergodic.

             Constructs a new ``MetropolisExchange`` sampler given a machine and a
             graph.

             Args:
                 machine: A machine $$\Psi(s)$$ used for the sampling.
                          The probability distribution being sampled
                          from is $$F(\Psi(s))$$, where the function
                          $$F(X)$$, is arbitrary, by default $$F(X)=|X|^2$$.
                 graph: A graph used to define the distances among the degrees
                        of freedom being sampled.
                 d_max: The maximum graph distance allowed for exchanges.

             Examples:
                 Sampling from a RBM machine in a 1D lattice of spin 1/2, using
                 nearest-neighbours exchanges.
