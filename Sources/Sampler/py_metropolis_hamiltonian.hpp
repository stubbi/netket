    Sampling based on the off-diagonal elements of a Hamiltonian (or a generic Operator).
    In this case, the transition matrix is taken to be:

    $$
    T( \mathbf{s} \rightarrow \mathbf{s}^\prime) = \frac{1}{\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{s})}\theta(|H_{\mathbf{s},\mathbf{s}^\prime}|),
    $$

    where $$ \theta(x) $$ is the Heaviside step function, and $$ \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{s}) $$
    is a state-dependent normalization.
    The effect of this transition probability is then to connect (with uniform probability)
    a given state $$ \mathbf{s} $$ to all those states $$ \mathbf{s}^\prime $$ for which the Hamiltonian has
    finite matrix elements.
    Notice that this sampler preserves by construction all the symmetries
    of the Hamiltonian. This is in generally not true for the local samplers instead.

             Constructs a new ``MetropolisHamiltonian`` sampler given a machine

                 machine: A machine $$\Psi(s)$$ used for the sampling.
                          The probability distribution being sampled
                          from is $$F(\Psi(s))$$, where the function

                 Sampling from a RBM machine in a 1D lattice of spin 1/2
