      This sampler acts locally only on one local degree of freedom $$s_i$$,
      and proposes a new state: $$ s_1 \dots s^\prime_i \dots s_N $$,
      where $$ s^\prime_i \neq s_i $$.

      The transition probability associated to this
      sampler can be decomposed into two steps:

      1. One of the site indices $$ i = 1\dots N $$ is chosen
      with uniform probability.
      2. Among all the possible ($$m$$) values that $$s_i$$ can take,
      one of them is chosen with uniform probability.

      For example, in the case of spin $$1/2$$ particles, $$m=2$$
      and the possible local values are $$s_i = -1,+1$$.
      In this case then `MetropolisLocal` is equivalent to flipping a random spin.

      In the case of bosons, with occupation numbers
      $$s_i = 0, 1, \dots n_{\mathrm{max}}$$, `MetropolisLocal`
      would pick a random local occupation number uniformly between $$0$$
      and $$n_{\mathrm{max}}$$.

                          The probability distribution being sampled
                          from is $$F(\Psi(s))$$, where the function
