    In many cases, in Sgd the learning rate $$\eta$$ should
    decay as a function of training iteration to prevent overshooting
    as the optimum is approached. AdaGrad is an adaptive learning
    rate algorithm that automatically scales the learning rate with a sum
    over past gradients. The vector $$\mathbf{g}$$ is initialized to zero.
    Given a stochastic estimate of the gradient of the cost function $$G(\mathbf{p})$$,
    the updates for $$g_k$$ and the parameter $$p_k$$ are

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    g^\prime_k &= g_k + G_k(\mathbf{p})^2\\
    p^\prime_k &= p_k - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{g_k + \epsilon}}G_k(\mathbf{p})
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    AdaGrad has been shown to perform particularly well when
    the gradients are sparse, but the learning rate may become too small
    after many updates because the sum over the squares of past gradients is cumulative.
