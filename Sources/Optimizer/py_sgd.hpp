        [Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent)
        is one of the most popular optimizers in machine learning applications.
        Given a stochastic estimate of the gradient of the cost function ($$ G(\mathbf{p}) $$),
        it performs the update:

        $$
        p^\prime_k = p_k -\eta G_k(\mathbf{p}),
        $$

        where $$ \eta $$ is the so-called learning rate.
        Nqs also implements two extensions to the simple SGD,
        the first one is $$ L_2 $$ regularization,
        and the second one is the possibility to set a decay
        factor $$ \gamma \leq 1 $$ for the learning rate, such that
        at iteration $$ n $$ the learning rate is $$ \eta \gamma^n $$.  )EOF")
